### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Ã–zkan Ã–ztÃ¼rk
#### Unity Game Developer


I'm Ã–zkan from Turkey. I have been deeply interested in software for two years. I started my first work experience in this field as a web developer and it took 5 months. Afterwards, I turned to the profession of game developer where creativity is at the forefront. I have been working as a game developer since 2022 November. I am improving myself in various languages, especially Unity and C#, in this area where continuous innovations are emerging and development is very important.


Skills: C# / Unity 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on RitimUS: Educational Games
