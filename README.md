### Hi there 👋

I'm Özkan from Turkey. I have been deeply interested in software for two years. I started my first work experience in this field as a web developer and it took 5 months. Afterwards, I turned to the profession of game developer where creativity is at the forefront. I have been working as a game developer since 2022 November. I am improving myself in various languages, especially Unity and C#, in this area where continuous innovations are emerging and development is very important.
